# Ideas:


## Software development in an organization
- Architecture?
- Who tracks quality?
- Wwho expresses what is needed?
- Who makes sure the solutions do fit together in an enterprise
- and why S.A.F.E. is good for enterprises

## IAM solutions in the cloud. Comparison.
- different IAM solutions in cloud: AD, LDAP, 
- how to enforce?
- how to maintain?
- which model to follow?
- custom or off the shelf?


## Deployment
- Kubernetes - Kubernitis
- Containers
- Serverless
