AWS Organizations is a service that lets you centralize management and governance of your AWS accounts and resources across multiple regions. With Organizations, you can create multiple AWS accounts to isolate different environments, such as production, development, and testing. You can also use Organizations to define policies that control access to resources and enforce compliance with your security and compliance standards.

### AWS Control Tower

Control Tower simplifies the process of provisioning and configuring new accounts, and it provides a central console for managing your AWS environment. With Control Tower, you can enforce security and compliance policies across your AWS accounts, and you can also automate common tasks, such as creating and configuring networks, VPCs, and security groups.

### AWS Config

AWS X-Ray is a service that helps you to debug and troubleshoot distributed applications. X-Ray can trace requests as they flow through your application and across multiple AWS services, and it can also help you to identify performance bottlenecks and identify potential security vulnerabilities.

These are just a few of the many AWS services that can help you to centralize governance in AWS. With the right combination of services, you can create a secure, compliant, and efficient AWS environment.

Firewall Manager uses **AWS Config** in the background.

AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that helps 
across **multiple accounts**

- centrally configure and manage **firewall rules**  and applications in AWS Organizations.  
- helps to provision **AWS WAF rules**, 
- create **AWS Shield advanced** protection, and 
- enable **security groups for Amazon EC2 instances** launched **across multiple accounts** in AWS Organizations. 


Following are the three prerequisites for using AWS Firewall Manager

1.  AWS Organizations should be used to manage accounts with all features enabled.
2.  One of the accounts in the AWS Organizations should be designated as an administrator for AWS Firewall Manager.
3.  Â AWS Config must be enabled on all the accounts within the AWS Organizations.

Once these prerequisites are met, AWS Firewall can be used to create a master security group. Policies are created in AWS Firewall which is applied to individual application security groups by mapping to specific application name/value tags.



### AWS Consolidated Billing

To use AWS Consolidated Billing, you must create a management account in AWS Organizations and add your member accounts to the organization. You can then enable consolidated billing for the organization. Once consolidated billing is enabled, AWS will automatically consolidate the usage and costs of all member accounts into a single invoice.



To enable consolidated billing, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **AWS Organizations** console and select the management account for which you want to enable consolidated billing.
2. In the **Accounts** section, select the **Member accounts** link.
3. Select the check box for the account that you want to add to consolidated billing.
4. Click the **Add to consolidated billing** button.
5. On the **Enable consolidated billing** page, select the **Enable consolidated billing** button.
