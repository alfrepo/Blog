## Intro

Reserarch on https://zededa.com/


### Summary Zededa

- NICE: based on eve-os, open source, nice https://lfedge.org/projects/eve/
  - eve-os update itself
- AVAILABLE: docker on edge - very important. Make the whole setup extendable
- AVAILABLE: immutable Linux distribution!
- AVAILABLE: Rollback capabilities!




#### Eve OS - avoid vendor lock in

##### Open Questions
- scaleability on edge to multiple machines to achieve High availability on edge? Unlear
			The write about Kubernetes on edge, but not clear how far they are
- are there APIs for the fleet management and integration?
- available apps for local GUIs?
