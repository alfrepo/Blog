   - Secure login with **multi-factor** authentication.
   - **Role-based access control RBAC** for users and administrators.

2. **Credit Card Management:**
   - Ability to **issue, activate, deactivate, and cancel credit cards**.
   - **Credit limit** setting and adjustments.
   -** Statement generation** and **transaction history** tracking.

3. **Transaction Processing:**
   - **Real-time transaction processing** with high throughput.
   - Support for **different transaction types** (purchases, refunds, cash advances).
   - **Integration with card networks** (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) for **authorization** and **clearing**.

4. **Fraud Detection and Prevention:**
   - Implement advanced fraud detection algorithms.
   - Real-time monitoring for suspicious activities and transactions.
   - Automated blockage of potentially fraudulent transactions.

5. **Billing and Payments:**
   - Billing cycle management with automated billing generation.
   - Secure payment processing and reconciliation.
   - Support for different payment methods and currencies.

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. **Security:**
   - Compliance with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data (card numbers, CVV codes).
   - Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

2. **Reliability and Availability:**
   - High availability with minimal downtime (99.99% uptime).
   - Disaster recovery plan and backup systems in place.

3. **Performance:**
   - Low latency for transaction processing (under a few seconds).
   - Scalability to handle peak transaction loads during high-traffic periods.

4. **Regulatory Compliance:**
   - Compliance with financial regulations and data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
   - Reporting capabilities to meet regulatory requirements.

5. **Audit Trails and Logging:**
   - Comprehensive logging of all system activities and transactions.
   - Ability to generate audit reports for compliance and analysis.

#### Technical Requirements:
1. **Technology Stack:**
   - Secure and robust programming languages and frameworks (e.g., Java, .NET, Python).
   - Use of secure protocols (TLS/SSL) for data transmission.
   - Database encryption and secure storage practices (encrypted at rest).

2. **Infrastructure and Hosting:**
   - Use of secure and reliable cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, etc.).
   - Redundant servers and load balancing for high availability.

3. **Scalability and Performance Testing:**
