## Description

Let's delve into the purpose and comparison of **Azure Defender**, **Azure Sentinel**, and **Azure Security Center**:


**Comparison**: üõ°Ô∏èüîç

  - **Azure Security Center** basic security. **Mostly static rules**. Collect logs, events. Security recommendations based on best practices.
  - **Azure Defender** Advanced. More Dynamic. Uses **threat intelligence and AI** to detect incident
  - **Azure Sentinel** combines **Security Information and Event Management** for manual with **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response** (SOAR) for automatic incident response.


**Overlap**: While they serve different purposes, there is some overlap in functionality, especially between Azure Security Center and Azure Defender.





1. **Azure Security Center**:

    - **Purpose**: Azure Security Center serves as your **"base layer"** for monitoring the security configuration and health of your workloads.
    - **Functionality**:
        - **Collects events** from Azure or log analytics agents.
        - **Correlates events** in a security analytics engine to provide tailored recommendations (hardening tasks).
        - Uses "Azure Policy" initiatives (such as the Azure Security Benchmark) and Azure Monitor logs.
        - Provides proactive security recommendations for Azure Compute, data, identity, access, and networking resources.
        - Includes a network map to visualize the topology of your Azure workloads.

2. **Azure Defender**:

    - **Purpose**: Azure Defender offers **advanced workload** protection.
    - **Functionality**:
        - Protects Azure resources (such as virtual machines, databases, containers, and more) against threats.
        - Uses threat intelligence and AI to detect and respond to security incidents.
        - Provides deep investigation tools to find the **scope and root cause of incidents**.
        - Enables powerful hunting, search, and query capabilities.
    - **Use Case**: Employ Azure Defender to enhance security for specific Azure workloads and services¬π.

3. **Azure Sentinel**:
    - **Purpose**: Azure Sentinel combines **Security Information and Event Management** (SIEM) with **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response** (SOAR).
    - **Functionality**:
        - Collects data from various sources (Azure, on-premises, and other clouds).
        - Uses AI and threat intelligence to detect threats across your environment.
        - **Correlates alerts** into incidents for efficient investigation.
        - Provides deep investigation tools and powerful hunting capabilities.
        - Enables automated response through playbooks.
    - **Use Case**: Azure Sentinel is ideal for comprehensive security monitoring, incident detection, and response across hybrid environments¬π.
