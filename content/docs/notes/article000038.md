## Description

AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) is a service that helps you securely share your AWS resources across multiple AWS accounts, 

 - within your organization or organizational units (OUs), and
 

### trusted service / trusted access


You MUST use **trusted access** to enable **AWS RAM service**,  (called the **trusted service**) to access your OU for sharing.

Trusted service AWS RAM will **perform tasks** in your **organization** and its **accounts** .

- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/using-orgs-trusted-access.html>
- RAM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ram/enable-sharing-with-aws-organization.html>


This involves **granting permissions to the trusted service** but does not otherwise affect the permissions for IAM users or roles.

When you enable access, the **trusted service** can create an IAM role called a **service-linked role** in **every account** in your organization.

#### service-linked role in every account

That **service-linked role** has a permissions policy that allows the **trusted service** to do tasks. 

This enables you to specify settings and configuration details that you would like the **trusted service** to maintain in your organizationâ€™s accounts on your behalf.


### enabling trusted access for trusted service via service-linked role

To enable **trusted access** with AWS Organizations:

 - From the AWS RAM CLI, use the `enable-sharing-with-aws-organizations` command.
 - Name of the `IAM service-linked role` that can be created in accounts when trusted access is enabled: 
`AWSResourceAccessManagerServiceRolePolicy`.
