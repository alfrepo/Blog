## Intro

What are platform teams


#### Whats a platform?

> A digital platform is a foundation of self-service APIs, tools,
services, knowledge and support which are arranged as a compelling
internal product. Autonomous delivery teams can make use of the
platform to deliver product features at a higher pace, with reduced
coordination

 - Plattform Value (Strategie), 
 - Plattform Customers, 
 - Plattform/Developer Experience 
 - Adoption Cycle.
